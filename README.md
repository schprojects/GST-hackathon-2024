# GST-hackathon-2024
 Repo for GST hackathon 2024

 * The code is written as Jupyter notebooks and would be easier to run in Google Colab (upload *.ipynb and run in colab)
 * Three files are included: GST_Hackathon_V2.ipynb, GST_inference.ipynb,GST_Model.pkl
 * GST_Hackathon_V2.ipynb - explains the process of selection of model by doing data munging, running experiments on different models and comparing metrics.
 * GST_inference.ipynb - uses the saved model to make inference after doing necessary transformations to match the trained model schema.
 * GST_Model.pkl - saved model
 * To run the inference just enter the path to csv file under INFERENCE_DATA_PATH and run the cells
